5. If you want to contribute for the project, but don't know where to start, check out the [Tesseract C API](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/master/api/capi.h) and see if there is something that is not implemented in the SwiftyTesseract API! Contributions to the documentation are also welcome.
